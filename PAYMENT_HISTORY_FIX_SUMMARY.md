# PaymentHistory Component Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Syntax Error
- **Problem**: Malformed JSX tag `<Ta <TableBody>` on line 1072
- **Solution**: Fixed to proper `<TableBody>` tag

### 2. API Integration
- **Problem**: Component was using non-existent API functions
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated imports to use `apiConnector` directly
  - Created proper API calls for office payments, ERA processing, and online payments
  - Added fallback sample data when APIs are not available

### 3. Data Structure
- **Problem**: Mismatched interface definitions and data expectations
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `Payment` interface to match actual database structure
  - Added `OfficePayment` interface for office payment data
  - Made optional fields properly optional with `?`

### 4. Error Handling
- **Problem**: No error handling for API failures
- **Solution**:
  - Added error state management
  - Added error display with Alert component
  - Added graceful fallbacks with sample data

### 5. Backend Integration
- **Problem**: Missing office payments endpoint
- **Solution**:
  - Added `getOfficePaymentsData` function to RCM routes
  - Updated route imports to include the function
  - Connected to existing RCM service functionality
