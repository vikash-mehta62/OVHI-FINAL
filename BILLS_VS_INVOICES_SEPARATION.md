# Bills vs Invoices Separation Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

You mentioned that "Invoices table is showing in billing and invoice" - I've created a clear separation between **Bills** (drafts) and **Invoices** (finalized) to organize your billing workflow properly.

## 📋 **Clear Separation**

### **📝 Bills (Draft Stage)**
- **Purpose**: Work-in-progress, editable documents
- **Status**: Draft, not yet sent to patients
- **Actions**: Edit, add services, generate invoice
- **Location**: Bills tab in the navigation

### **🧾 Invoices (Finalized Stage)**
- **Purpose**: Finalized documents sent to patients
- **Status**: Pending payment, paid, overdue
- **Actions**: View, download PDF, record payments
- **Location**: Invoices tab in the navigation

## 📁 **New Components Created**

### **1. BillingNavigation.tsx** - Main Navigation
- **Purpose**: Tab-based navigation between Bills and Invoices
- **Features**: 
  - Bills tab (shows draft bills)
  - Invoices tab (shows finalized invoices)
  - Create new bill functionality
  - View details for both bills and invoices

### **2. InvoicesList.tsx** - Invoices Management
- **Purpose**: Display and manage finalized invoices
- **Features**:
  - Invoice status tracking (Pending, Paid, Overdue)
  - Payment history
  - Revenue statistics
  - Download/email functionality
  - Payment recording

### **3. BillingDemo.tsx** - Updated Demo
- **Purpose**: Complete demo showing the separation
- **Usage**: `import BillingDemo from '@/components/billing/BillingDemo';`

## 🎨 **Visual Organization**

### **Bills Tab Features**:
- ✅ **Draft Status**: Yellow badges for work-in-progress
- ✅ **Edit Actions**: Modify services, quantities, prices
- ✅ **Generate Invoice**: Convert to finalized invoice

### **Invoices Tab Features**:

## 🔄 **Workflow Process**

```
1. Create Bill (Draft) → 2. Add Services → 3. Generate Invoice → 4. Send to Patient → 5. Record Payment
     📝 Bills Tab              📝 Bills Tab         🧾 Invoices Tab      🧾 Invoices Tab      🧾 Invoices Tab
```

## 📊 **Data Structure Differences**

### **Bills Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  patient_id: 12,
  status: "draft",           // Always draft
  total_amount: 150.00,
  patient_name: "John Doe",
  items: [...],
  created_at: "2024-01-15"
}
```

### **Invoices Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  invoice_number: "INV-2024-0001",  // Unique invoice number
  bill_id: 1,                       // Reference to original bill
  patient_id: 12,
  status: "pending",                // pending, paid, overdue
  total_amount: 150.00,
  amount_paid: 0.00,               // Track payments
  amount_due: 150.00,              // Remaining balance
  due_date: "2024-02-15",          // Payment due date
  patient_name: "John Doe",
  items: [...],
  payments: [...]                   // Payment history
}
```

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **Complete Billing System**:
```tsx
import BillingDemo from '@/components/billing/BillingDemo';

function App() {
  return <BillingDemo />;
}
```

### **Individual Components**:
```tsx
import BillingNavigation from '@/components/billing/BillingNavigation';

function BillingPage() {
  return <BillingNavigation />;
}
```

### **Bills Only**:
```tsx
import BillsListSimple from '@/components/billing/BillsListSimple';

<BillsListSimple
  onCreateNew={() => navigate('/bills/create')}
  onViewBill={(id) => navigate(`/bills/${id}`)}
  onGenerateInvoice={(id) => generateInvoice(id)}
/>
```

### **Invoices Only**:
```tsx
import InvoicesList from '@/components/billing/InvoicesList';

<InvoicesList
  onViewInvoice={(id) => navigate(`/invoices/${id}`)}
  onRecordPayment={(id) => openPaymentModal(id)}
  onDownloadInvoice={(id) => downloadPDF(id)}
/>
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**
