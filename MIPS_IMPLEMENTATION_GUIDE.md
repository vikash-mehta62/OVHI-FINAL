- Encounters/visits table for performance calculation

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Database Setup

Run the MIPS system setup script:

```bash
node setup-mips-system.js
```

This will:
- Create all MIPS database tables
- Insert sample quality measures, PI measures, and IA activities
- Set up configuration data for 2024 performance year
- Create sample provider eligibility records
- Install stored procedures for calculations

### 2. Backend Integration

The MIPS routes are automatically integrated into your existing API structure:

```javascript
// Already added to server/services/index.js
router.use("/mips", verifyToken, mipsRoutes);
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

The MIPS page is accessible at `/provider/mips` and has been added to the navigation sidebar.

### 4. Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file includes:

```env
# Database configuration (existing)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=ovhi_db

# MIPS-specific configuration (optional)
MIPS_PERFORMANCE_YEAR=2024
MIPS_SUBMISSION_DEADLINE=2025-03-31
MIPS_AUTO_CALCULATION=true
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Eligibility Determination
```
Provider Profile → Calculate Metrics → Determine Status → Store Results
```

### 2. Measure Selection
```
Available Measures → Specialty Filter → Provider Selection → Validation → Storage
```

### 3. Performance Tracking
```
EHR Data → Measure Logic → Performance Calculation → Score Assignment
```

### 4. Submission Process
```
Data Validation → Score Calculation → Gap Analysis → Final Submission
```

## 📈 Performance Calculation

### Quality Category (45% weight)
- Minimum 6 measures required
- At least 1 outcome measure (when available)
- 20+ cases per measure minimum
- 70%+ data completeness required
- Benchmark-based scoring (1-10 points)

### Promoting Interoperability (25% weight)
- Base measures (required): e-Prescribing, Health Information Exchange
- Performance measures (optional): PDMP Query, Public Health Reporting
- Bonus measures: Information Blocking Attestation, ONC Health IT Certification

### Improvement Activities (15% weight)
- Minimum 40 points required
- Medium weight activities: 10 points
- High weight activities: 20 points
- 90+ consecutive days required

### Cost Category (15% weight)
- Automatically calculated by CMS
- Based on Medicare claims data
- Episode-based and per-capita measures

## 🎯 Scoring Algorithm

### Composite Score Calculation
```javascript
compositeScore = (qualityScore * 0.45) + (piScore * 0.25) + (iaScore * 0.15) + (costScore * 0.15)
```

### Payment Adjustment
```javascript
if (compositeScore >= 75) {
  adjustment = ((compositeScore - 75) / 25) * 9.0  // Positive adjustment
} else {
  adjustment = -((75 - compositeScore) / 75) * 9.0  // Negative adjustment
}
```

## 🔍 Data Gap Analysis

The system automatically identifies gaps in:

### Quality Data Gaps
- Insufficient case volume (< 20 cases)
- Low data completeness (< 70%)
- Missing performance data
- Invalid measure selections

### PI Evidence Gaps
- Missing attestations
- Incomplete documentation
- Below threshold performance
- Required measure gaps

### IA Documentation Gaps
- Insufficient points (< 40)
- Missing 90-day periods
- Incomplete attestations
- Missing supporting evidence

## 📅 Timeline Management

### Performance Year Timeline
- **January 1 - December 31**: Data collection period
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Progress assessment and gap identification
- **January 2 - March 31** (following year): Submission period

### Key Milestones
- **Q1 Review**: March 31 - First quarter assessment
- **Mid-Year**: June 30 - Performance evaluation
- **Q3 Check**: September 30 - Final adjustments
- **Year End**: December 31 - Data collection complete
- **Submission**: March 31 - Final deadline

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- All MIPS data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control (providers only)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Audit Trail
- All actions logged with user, timestamp, and IP
- Data change tracking (old/new values)
- Performance calculation history
- Submission attempt logging

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Data
The setup script creates comprehensive sample data including:
- 7 quality measures across specialties
- 6 PI measures (base, performance, bonus)
- 12 improvement activities across all subcategories
- Sample provider eligibility records
- Performance data and attestations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Eligible Provider**: Full MIPS participation workflow
2. **Exempt Provider**: Low-volume threshold exemption
3. **Not Eligible**: Below participation thresholds
4. **Data Gaps**: Various gap scenarios and remediation

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Measures
```sql
INSERT INTO mips_quality_measures (
  measure_id, measure_title, measure_type, collection_type,
  specialty_set, performance_year, ...
) VALUES (...);
```

### Specialty Configuration
Update the specialty mappings in `mips_configuration`:
```json
{
  "specialty_name": {
    "code": "XX",
    "name": "Specialty Name",
    "measures": ["001", "002", "003"]
  }
}
```

### Performance Year Updates
1. Update configuration for new performance year
2. Add new measures and activities
3. Update benchmark data
4. Adjust scoring thresholds

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- **Monthly**: Review data gaps and performance
- **Quarterly**: Update benchmark data
- **Annually**: Add new performance year configuration
- **As needed**: Update measures and activities per CMS

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Eligibility not calculated**: Check NPI/TIN in provider profile
2. **Performance not calculating**: Verify encounter data and CPT codes
3. **Measures not available**: Check specialty mapping configuration
4. **Submission errors**: Review data completeness and validation

#### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```env
MIPS_DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **EHR Integration**: Direct data extraction from certified EHRs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance tracking
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting and recommendations
- **Group Reporting**: Multi-provider practice support
- **Mobile App**: Provider mobile access
- **API Integrations**: Third-party quality reporting tools

### Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Core MIPS functionality ✅
- **Phase 2**: Advanced analytics and reporting
- **Phase 3**: EHR integration and automation
- **Phase 4**: AI-powered recommendations
- **Phase 5**: Multi-program support (APMs, etc.)
