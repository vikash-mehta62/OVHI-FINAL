RISK ASSESSMENT:
[Analyze the patient's current risk level based on their responses. Consider medication adherence, symptom frequency, lifestyle factors, and any concerning patterns. Be specific about what indicates higher or lower risk.]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
[Provide specific, actionable recommendations tailored to their condition and responses. Include:
- Medication management tips
- Lifestyle modifications
- Monitoring suggestions
- Self-care strategies
- Dietary recommendations if applicable]

NEXT STEPS:
[Outline immediate and long-term actions:
- When to contact healthcare providers
- Follow-up scheduling recommendations
- Monitoring frequency
- Warning signs to watch for]

URGENT CONCERNS:
[Identify any responses that indicate immediate medical attention may be needed. If no urgent concerns exist, state "No immediate urgent concerns identified based on current responses." Be conservative - err on the side of caution.]`;
