# Lab Integration System Requirements

## Introduction

The Lab Integration System enables healthcare providers to create lab referrals and e-orders, send orders through multiple channels (PDF/e-fax, FHIR, HL7), ingest and process results (PDF + discrete values), and manage provider review/sign-off with patient portal release capabilities. This system provides a complete workflow from lab ordering to result consumption with full interoperability support and compliance features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lab Order Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to create lab orders from a comprehensive lab compendium with proper medical necessity documentation, so that I can efficiently order appropriate tests for my patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider accesses the lab ordering interface THEN the system SHALL display available lab facilities with their supported transport methods
2. WHEN a provider selects a lab facility THEN the system SHALL load the lab compendium with test codes, LOINC mappings, specimen types, units, and reference ranges
3. WHEN a provider adds tests to an order THEN the system SHALL require ICD-10 codes for medical necessity
4. WHEN payer or lab rules indicate ABN requirement THEN the system SHALL prompt for ABN signature before order completion
5. WHEN creating an order THEN the system SHALL auto-populate ordering context from Settings including rendering NPI, taxonomy, organization details, CLIA, and service location
6. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique order number and set status to "draft"
7. WHEN an order contains all required information THEN the system SHALL allow provider to sign and advance status to "signed"

### Requirement 2: Multi-Channel Order Transmission

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to send lab orders through different channels based on lab facility capabilities, so that I can ensure reliable order delivery regardless of the receiving lab's technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending via PDF/e-fax THEN the system SHALL generate a requisition PDF with patient demographics, order details, provider information, ICD-10 codes, and barcodes
2. WHEN sending via FHIR R4 THEN the system SHALL create ServiceRequest resources with optional Specimen resources
3. WHEN sending via HL7 v2 THEN the system SHALL generate OML^O21 or ORM^O01 messages with MSH, PID, ORC, OBR, DG1, SPM, and NTE segments
4. WHEN an order is sent THEN the system SHALL update status to "sent" and log transmission details
5. WHEN acknowledgment is received THEN the system SHALL update status to "ack" and record timestamp
6. WHEN transmission fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and allow retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3: Results Ingestion and Processing

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to receive lab results through multiple channels with discrete data extraction and abnormal value flagging, so that I can efficiently review and act on patient results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving FHIR results THEN the system SHALL process DiagnosticReport and Observation resources with optional DocumentReference for PDFs
2. WHEN receiving HL7 ORU^R01 messages THEN the system SHALL extract OBX segments mapping code, value, units, reference range, abnormal flags, and status
3. WHEN results are received THEN the system SHALL store the full payload securely and extract discrete observations
4. WHEN results contain abnormal or critical values THEN the system SHALL flag them and create provider inbox tasks
5. WHEN critical results are received THEN the system SHALL trigger escalation notifications to on-call providers with retry logic
6. WHEN results are processed THEN the system SHALL link any PDF attachments to the corresponding order
7. WHEN partial results are received THEN the system SHALL update status to "partial" and allow for additional result updates

### Requirement 4: Provider Review and Patient Portal Release

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to review lab results with trending capabilities and selectively release results to the patient portal, so that I can ensure appropriate patient communication and care continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing results THEN the system SHALL display discrete observations with abnormal flags and reference ranges
2. WHEN viewing historical results THEN the system SHALL provide trend graphs per LOINC code comparing to previous values
3. WHEN a provider reviews results THEN the system SHALL allow marking as "reviewed" with digital signature
4. WHEN releasing to patient portal THEN the system SHALL apply configurable redaction rules for sensitive results
5. WHEN results are released THEN the system SHALL log the release event with timestamp and provider identification
6. WHEN results require follow-up THEN the system SHALL allow providers to add clinical notes and care plan updates

### Requirement 5: Lab Referral Generation

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to generate comprehensive lab referral PDFs for external facilities without electronic interfaces, so that I can ensure proper patient care coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a referral THEN the system SHALL include patient demographics, provider information, requested tests, ICD-10 codes, and clinical instructions
2. WHEN creating referral PDF THEN the system SHALL add clinic stamp, provider signature, and QR code linking to patient portal
3. WHEN sending referrals via e-fax THEN the system SHALL provide delivery receipt confirmation
4. WHEN referral is generated THEN the system SHALL log the referral event for audit purposes

### Requirement 6: Billing Integration and Medical Necessity

**User Story:** As a billing administrator, I want lab orders to capture billing-relevant information and support in-house procedures, so that I can ensure proper revenue cycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orders include in-house draws THEN the system SHALL support CPT code 36415 and other clinic-performed procedures
2. WHEN creating orders THEN the system SHALL store ICD-10 codes used for medical necessity documentation
3. WHEN ICD-10 codes are missing THEN the system SHALL warn providers before order completion
4. WHEN orders are completed THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing RCM module for billing workflow
5. WHEN ABN is required THEN the system SHALL capture patient signature and store for compliance

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the lab system to maintain HIPAA compliance with full audit trails and secure data handling, so that we meet regulatory requirements and protect patient privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling PHI THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit using TLS/SSL
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL redact PHI from log files while maintaining audit trail integrity
3. WHEN storing raw payloads THEN the system SHALL use secure database columns with encryption
4. WHEN critical results require escalation THEN the system SHALL track acknowledgment and retry attempts
5. WHEN BAA agreements exist THEN the system SHALL enforce per-facility security requirements
6. WHEN audit events occur THEN the system SHALL log order creation, transmission, result receipt, review, and release events
7. WHEN data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL support configurable retention periods with secure deletion

### Requirement 8: System Integration and Interoperability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the lab system to integrate seamlessly with existing OVHI modules and external systems, so that providers have a unified workflow experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing lab orders THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Patient and Encounter modules
2. WHEN using HL7 interfaces THEN the system SHALL support optional Mirth/NextGen Connect integration
3. WHEN authenticating with external systems THEN the system SHALL support OAuth2 and API key authentication
4. WHEN configuring lab facilities THEN the system SHALL leverage existing Settings module for provider, organization, and location data
5. WHEN processing results THEN the system SHALL update patient records and trigger relevant clinical decision support rules
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing notification and alerting systems
