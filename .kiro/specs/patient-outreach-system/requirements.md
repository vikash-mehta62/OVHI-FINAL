# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Patient Interaction & Outreach module is a comprehensive communication system designed to enhance patient engagement, reduce no-shows, and support compliant marketing campaigns for healthcare providers. This system will automatically schedule and send personalized communications across multiple channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp) while respecting patient preferences, timezones, and regulatory compliance requirements including HIPAA, CAN-SPAM, and TCPA.

The module integrates with the existing OVHI healthcare platform to leverage patient data, appointment schedules, and provider settings while maintaining strict data privacy and security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Patient Communication Preferences Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to manage patient communication preferences at multiple levels (global, organization, provider, and patient-specific) so that I can respect patient choices and optimize communication effectiveness.

5. IF a patient sets quiet hours THEN the system SHALL NOT schedule communications during those times in their local timezone
6. WHEN a patient opts out of a communication channel THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all future communications on that channel
7. WHEN a patient responds with "STOP" to SMS/WhatsApp THEN the system SHALL automatically update their consent preferences
