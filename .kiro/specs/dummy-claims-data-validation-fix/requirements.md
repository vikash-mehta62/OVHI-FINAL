# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the NaN (Not a Number) values appearing in the dummy claims data setup system. The issue occurs when the system attempts to parse null or undefined values as numbers, resulting in NaN values being displayed in reports and data summaries. This fix will implement proper data validation and null handling to ensure clean, reliable test data for the RCM system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer setting up test data, I want the dummy claims data setup to handle null values properly, so that I don't see NaN values in the output reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters null or undefined total_amount values THEN it SHALL display "0.00" instead of "NaN"
2. WHEN the system processes SUM() aggregations with null values THEN it SHALL use COALESCE or IFNULL to provide default values
3. WHEN parseFloat() is called on potentially null values THEN it SHALL check for null/undefined before parsing
4. WHEN displaying monetary amounts THEN the system SHALL always show properly formatted currency values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer running data verification queries, I want consistent numeric formatting in all output displays, so that the data appears professional and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying claim amounts THEN the system SHALL format all amounts to 2 decimal places
2. WHEN showing summary totals THEN the system SHALL handle cases where no records exist (null sums)
3. WHEN outputting patient names THEN the system SHALL handle cases where patient data might be missing
4. WHEN displaying status counts THEN the system SHALL show 0 instead of null for empty categories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the RCM system, I want robust error handling in the data setup scripts, so that I can identify and fix data issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL queries return null results THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful default values
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log specific error details with context
3. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other records and report issues
4. WHEN displaying verification results THEN the system SHALL show clear success/failure indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA tester validating the RCM system, I want the dummy data to be consistent and realistic, so that testing scenarios are reliable and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating test claims THEN all monetary amounts SHALL be valid positive numbers
2. WHEN creating patient profiles THEN all required fields SHALL have non-null values
3. WHEN inserting payment records THEN amounts SHALL match corresponding claim amounts
4. WHEN setting up aging buckets THEN date calculations SHALL be accurate and consistent
