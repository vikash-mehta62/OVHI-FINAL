# RCM Module Code Review & Refactoring Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive review and refactoring of the Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) module to eliminate duplicate code, improve frontend implementation quality, standardize patterns, and enhance maintainability. The RCM module is a critical component of the OVHI healthcare platform that handles medical billing, claims processing, payment collection, and revenue analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Duplication Analysis & Elimination

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to eliminate duplicate code across the RCM module so that the codebase is more maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing RCM backend services THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate functions like `formatCurrency`, `formatDate`, and database connection patterns
2. WHEN examining frontend components THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate UI imports, state management patterns, and data fetching logic
3. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate validation, error handling, and response formatting code
4. WHEN finding duplicate business logic THEN the system SHALL extract common functions into shared utilities with proper error handling
5. WHEN consolidating database queries THEN the system SHALL create reusable query builders and connection management utilities
6. WHEN standardizing imports THEN the system SHALL create barrel exports and consistent import patterns across components

### Requirement 2: Frontend Component Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want properly structured and optimized React components so that the user interface is performant and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing RCM components THEN the system SHALL identify components with missing error boundaries and loading states
2. WHEN analyzing large components like `RCMDashboard.tsx` THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to break them into smaller, focused components
3. WHEN examining data fetching THEN the system SHALL identify components that fetch data without proper caching or error handling
4. WHEN reviewing TypeScript usage THEN the system SHALL identify missing interfaces, `any` types, and improper type assertions
5. WHEN analyzing component performance THEN the system SHALL identify unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, and inefficient state updates
6. WHEN examining user experience THEN the system SHALL identify missing accessibility features, keyboard navigation, and responsive design issues

### Requirement 3: Backend Service Standardization

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want consistent service patterns and error handling so that the API is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing RCM controllers THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent error handling between `rcmCtrl.js`, `collectionsCtrl.js`, and other service files
2. WHEN analyzing database connections THEN the system SHALL identify mixed connection patterns (some using connection pools, others creating new connections)
3. WHEN examining API responses THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent response formats and missing standardized error codes
4. WHEN reviewing input validation THEN the system SHALL identify endpoints missing proper request validation and sanitization
5. WHEN analyzing transaction management THEN the system SHALL identify operations that need atomic transactions but lack proper rollback handling
6. WHEN examining security THEN the system SHALL identify endpoints missing proper authentication, authorization, and input sanitization

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized RCM module performance so that users experience fast response times and efficient resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing RCM database queries THEN the system SHALL identify complex joins in `getRCMDashboardData` and similar functions that could benefit from indexing or query optimization
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL identify endpoints like `getClaimsStatus` that lack proper pagination and could cause performance issues with large datasets
3. WHEN examining frontend data fetching THEN the system SHALL identify components that fetch data on every render without proper dependency arrays or caching
4. WHEN analyzing component rendering THEN the system SHALL identify large components like `RCMDashboard` that re-render entire sections when only small parts change
5. WHEN reviewing memory management THEN the system SHALL identify database connections that aren't properly closed and frontend subscriptions that aren't cleaned up
6. WHEN examining code splitting THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to lazy load RCM components and reduce initial bundle size

### Requirement 5: Code Quality & Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want consistent coding standards and quality across the RCM module so that the code is readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code formatting THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent naming conventions and formatting
2. WHEN analyzing function complexity THEN the system SHALL identify functions that exceed complexity thresholds
3. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL identify missing or outdated comments and documentation
4. WHEN reviewing type safety THEN the system SHALL identify missing TypeScript types and any usage
5. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL identify untested code paths and missing test cases
6. WHEN examining security THEN the system SHALL identify potential security vulnerabilities and data exposure

### Requirement 6: Architecture & Design Pattern Consistency

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want consistent design patterns and architecture across the RCM module so that the system is scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing service layer THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent service patterns and abstractions
2. WHEN analyzing data access THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent repository patterns and data access methods
3. WHEN examining component architecture THEN the system SHALL identify components that violate separation of concerns
4. WHEN reviewing state management THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent Redux patterns and state structure
5. WHEN analyzing error handling THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent error handling and user feedback patterns
6. WHEN examining API design THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent REST patterns and response structures

### Requirement 7: Refactoring Implementation Plan

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a structured refactoring plan so that improvements can be implemented systematically without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prioritizing refactoring tasks THEN the system SHALL address critical issues first (security, data integrity) followed by performance and maintainability improvements
2. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API contracts and database schemas during the refactoring process
3. WHEN organizing work phases THEN the system SHALL group backend utilities first, then service layer improvements, followed by frontend component refactoring
4. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL account for testing time, code review cycles, and potential rollback scenarios
5. WHEN measuring success THEN the system SHALL track metrics like code duplication percentage, component complexity scores, and API response times
6. WHEN planning testing THEN the system SHALL require unit tests for new utilities, integration tests for refactored services, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows

### Requirement 8: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation of the refactored RCM module so that I can understand and maintain the improved codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of refactoring decisions
2. WHEN creating guides THEN the system SHALL include examples of new patterns and best practices
3. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL reflect the new architecture and component structure
4. WHEN providing migration guides THEN the system SHALL explain how to adapt existing code to new patterns
5. WHEN creating reference materials THEN the system SHALL include coding standards and style guides
6. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive endpoint documentation with examples
